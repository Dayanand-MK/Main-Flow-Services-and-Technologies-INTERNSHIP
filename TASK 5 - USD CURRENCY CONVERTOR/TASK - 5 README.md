# TASK-5 : Creating a USD currency converter application with GUI

**Description:**

  Develop a USD currency converter application with a graphical user interface (GUI) in Python. The application will allow users to input an amount in USD and
  convert it to various other currencies based on the latest exchange rates. The application should be easy to use and provide accurate, up-to- date conversion rates.

**Responsibility:**

  1. Environment Setup:
       • Install Python and necessary libraries (e.g., Tkinter for GUI, requests for API calls).
  
  2. Currency Conversion Logic:
       • Implement the logic to convert USD to selected currencies using the fetched exchange rates.
       • Ensure accurate calculations and handle edge cases (e.g., very large or small amounts).
  
  3. GUI Design and Development:
       • Design the layout of the application using Tkinter or any other Python GUI framework.
       • Create input fields for the USD amount and dropdown menus for selecting target currencies.
       • Add buttons for performing the conversion and refreshing exchange rates.
